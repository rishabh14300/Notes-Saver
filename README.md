# Notes-Saver

This is a website used for saving personal notes of an user. This app is useful for day-to-day life for checking those works which are important or we can forget it easily. So that we can keep a track of this using this website. 

This website is built using React JS which is a framework of javascript. Additionaly I am using backend to save the data.

Here are some images attached below about its work.
